 An important survival capability is to attend to outstanding objects or stimulai in the sensory environment without thinking.
 
 The saliency is the capacity of a stimulai to grab attention. A fixation point which will draw the involuntary attention.
 
 Computer vision attempts to simulate detection of "saliency in images". Or detection of saliency in images that presumably matches a human perception. 
 Such techniques produce a "saliency map" which then is compared to the ground truth mask of a given image.
 
 There are two broad categories of saliency detection techniques: 
 
 1. bottom-up
 1.1 local
 1.2 global
 2. top-down
